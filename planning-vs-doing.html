<h1> Planning vs Doing </h1>

Often, planning gets in the way of "doing" </br>
Planning is a great way to fool myself into thinking that I am making progress. </br>
</p>

Don't get me wrong. Planning is useful! Very important in many cases. </br>
But we should not mistake producing a plan with producing actual result. </br>
